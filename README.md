# Thrift Fund
#### FBLA Mobile App Competition 2017 (Virtual Yard Sale)

## Documentation

The app documentation and instructions are best viewed here <a href="https://thrift.fund/">thrift.fund</a> Or by loading up the ```index.html``` found in ```./documentaion```





#### Running The App In XCode (IOS)

  Running the app locally in XCode is super simple! Under ```./buildIOS``` run ```Thift Fund.xcode``` then after Xcode opens click emulate selecting a target device (I recommend using a standard size iphone 7)

***Since the app requires an API the computer must be able to connect to the internet, and able to navigate to <a href="https://thrift.fund/">thrift.fund</a>***
