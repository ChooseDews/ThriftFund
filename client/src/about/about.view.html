I'm Raising funds

</div>

<p>

  I'm raising funds to go to the FBLA National Leadership Conference which is in Anaheim, California. In order to achieve this I'm getting people to donate things for me to sell toward my trip.


</p>

<p>I've made this app for people to donate, look, comment, and share. Hopefully funding me on my trip.</p>
