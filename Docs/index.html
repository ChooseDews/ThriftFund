                    Thrift Fund is an app that allows other people to donate items to be sold for your cause. In my implementation it works very close to the likes of Craigslist. The technology used behind the app is cordova for the front end and node.js for the backend
                    (or API).

                <p>
                    <br>

                    I built Thrift Fund to work on both Andriod and IOS. I have taken the liberity to publish the app to the App Store which means
                    <b>install is super simple for IOS devices and doesn't require running anything locally.</b>

                    <br><br>

                    <button class="btn btn-outline mb1 blue">App Store Link</button>

                    <br><br>

                    You can also open the precompiled app in
                    <file>client/cordova/platform/ios</file>
                    with XCode to run there. Bare in mind that the app is programmed to interact with https://thrift.fund/ which is a hosted API from the code found in
                    <file>server</file>

                    Running the app locally through an emulator is a more advanced process but can be easily achieved. The app is separating into two main components client and server.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Prerequisites:
                    </b>
                    To run the app you must be on a OSX system with Node v7 and XCode installed.
                    <br>
                    After Node is installed run
                    <file>npm install -g bower grunt cordova</file>

                    <br><br>

                    <file>client/</file>
                    contains everything needed to compile and run the front end of the app, the produced app files can be found in
                    <file>client/cordova/platform/ios</file>. To compile the app on a unix system from the
                    <file>client/</file>
                    directory run
                    <file>npm install && bower install && grunt compile</file>
                    after this is complete you can compile the IOS app iself by runnning
                    <file>cordova emulate ios --target="iPhone-7, 10.2"</file>
                    This should start up ios emulator and will only work on Mac OSX with XCode installed.

                    <br>
                    Thrift Fund relies on a server to handle storing items, images, and users. In
                    <file>server/</file>
                    you can see the code running the API found on https://thrift.fund/. The server uses Mongodb as its database and JWT for user authentication. Sidenote if you are running locally and don't want to use the demo database you must modify the database
                    connection string in
                    <file>server/config.js</file>
                    <br><br>
                    The API has three main functions founds in
                    <file>server/services</file>
                    which are managing items, users, and users wishlists. The client is able to use the API routes from
                    <file>server/routes</file>
                    to update and retrieve data.
